# Node Entity Reference Publish Status Filter

Adds the ability to filter Node Entities for Entity Reference only if they are published. This includes admin users. Useful for when admin users need to create content but only want to have options of published Entities. Note this extends EntityReference_SelectionHandler_Generic_node so you still have the ability to filter by Node types.
